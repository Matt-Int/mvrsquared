R-squared for outcomes in single or multiple dimensions based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11061).

Things to do:
1. Set this up with travis CI
2. Make a proper readme that references the paper
3. Make a vignette that has *real* examples that I don't want to put in function examples
4. Make a details section in the help of calc_rsquared that explains y and yhat inputs
